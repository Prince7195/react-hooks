useCallback:

useCallback is modified based on the give param changed

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((count) => count + 1);
}, [setCount]);

this will not be re created for every time if it is passed as a prop to the child component, not create as a function in the parent itself
Not Ex:
<Button increase={() => increment()} />

Yes Ex:
<Button increase={increment} />
